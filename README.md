# OIBSIP_TASK1
Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

Objective: Classify iris flowers into species based on their physical features.

Steps: Loaded and explored the dataset, preprocessed data, split it into training and testing sets, trained a classification model, and evaluated its performance.

Tools Used: Python libraries including Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook.

Outcome: Achieved high accuracy in correctly predicting the species of iris flowers using the trained model.
